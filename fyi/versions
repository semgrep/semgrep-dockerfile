      fix(dockerfile): Allow Semgrep ellipsis in healthcheck instruction
      
      This had previously been omitted, so the test cases that I've added here
      failed to parse. When parsing dockerfile patterns, we fall back to
      parsing them as Bash if they fail to parse as Dockerfile. These examples
      parsed successfully as Bash, but the trees generated did not match, so
      these silently failed to match where they should.
      
      Test plan: Automated tests.
